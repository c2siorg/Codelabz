            # Pull Request Approval Process

            Welcome and thank you for your contribution! To ensure a smooth and efficient review process, please adhere to the following guidelines when submitting your Pull Request (PR):

            ## Testing Your Code

            Before submitting your PR, ensure that your code passes all tests. Our Continuous Integration (CI) system will verify:

            - **Code Coverage:** Ensure there is no reduction in overall code coverage below the target threshold.
            - **File Coverage:** Ensure no individual file in the PR falls below the coverage threshold.
            - **Merge Conflicts:** Resolve any merge conflicts before submission.

            ## Reviewers

            Please do not assign reviewers yourself. Our project maintainers will review your PR and assign appropriate reviewers. You can communicate with your assigned reviewers through:

            - **Comments:** Directly within this PR.
            - **Slack:** Our project’s Slack channel for real-time communication.

            ## Reviewing Your Code

            Your assigned reviewers will:

            - Conduct a thorough review of your code.
            - Mediate any future discussions regarding the validity and necessity of your changes.
            - Evaluate the quality and correctness of your work.
            - Verify and ensure closure of related issues referenced in the PR.
            - Provide guidance on any required test fixes.

            ## CONTRIBUTING.md

            Please ensure you have read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file. Key points include:

            - **Issue Assignment:** PRs must reference assigned issues; PRs without assigned issues will be closed by the reviewer.
            - **Issue References:** Ensure the first comment in the PR includes references to automatically close related issues upon merging.

            ## Other Guidelines

            - **Respect Volunteers' Time:** Be considerate of our volunteers’ time. Avoid directly contacting the person who assigned reviewers unless explicitly requested to do so.
            - **Code of Conduct:** Adhere to the project’s [Code of Conduct](./code_of_conduct.md) in all interactions.

            ## Closing Your PR

            If you need to close your PR, please provide a comment explaining the reason for closure. This helps us understand your decision and can provide insights for future contributions.

            ---

            Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your adherence to these guidelines ensures a streamlined and effective review process, helping us maintain the quality and integrity of our project.
            Happy coding!
