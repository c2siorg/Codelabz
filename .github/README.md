## 3. Issue Labeler Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/label_issues.yml`

This workflow automatically labels issues based on predefined criteria specified in the `labeler-v1.yml` file.

**Trigger Events:**

- `issues`: Triggered when an issue is opened or edited.

**Usage:**

- Labels issues based on patterns defined in the `labeler-v1.yml` configuration file.

## 4. Cypress End-to-End Tests Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/cypress.yml`

This workflow conducts end-to-end tests using Cypress, ensuring the quality and functionality of the application.

**Trigger Events:**

- `pull_request`: Triggered on pull requests to any branch.
- `push`: Triggered on pushes to any branch.

**Usage:**

- Executes tests in parallel on multiple containers, enhancing efficiency and saving time.
- Deploys Firebase emulators for testing with environment variables.
- Records test results in Cypress Cloud for analysis.
- Prints Cypress Cloud URL for result visualization.
- Handles failures by uploading artifacts and notifying contributors.

## 5. Deploy to Firebase Hosting on Merge Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml`

This workflow automatically deploys the application to Firebase Hosting upon merging changes into the master branch.

**Trigger Events:**

- `push`: Triggered on pushes to the master branch.

**Usage:**

- Checks out the repository and sets up the Node.js environment.
- Creates a `.env` file with secrets required for Firebase authentication.
- Installs dependencies and builds the application.
- Deploys the application to Firebase Hosting using Firebase Hosting Deploy action.

## 6. Deploy to Firebase Hosting on Pull Request Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml`

This workflow deploys a preview of the application to Firebase Hosting for every pull request targeting the master branch.

**Trigger Events:**

- `pull_request`: Triggered on pull requests to the master branch.

**Usage:**

- Checks out the repository and sets up the Node.js environment.
- Creates a `.env` file with secrets required for Firebase authentication.
- Installs dependencies and builds the application.
- Deploys the application to a preview channel on Firebase Hosting for testing and review purposes.

## 7. Pull Request Labeler Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/label-pull-requests.yml`

This workflow automatically assigns labels to pull requests based on changes made in the pull request files or their originating branches.

**Trigger Events:**

- `pull_request_target`: Triggered when a pull request is opened or synchronized, and its base branch is not on the repository.

**Usage:**

- Automatically assigns labels to pull requests to categorize them based on the changes made or their nature.
- Enhances organization and consistency in pull request management.

**Configuration File:** `labeler.yml`

This file contains the rules used by the Pull Request Labeler Workflow to determine which labels to apply to pull requests based on specific criteria.

---

## 8. Pull Request Target Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/pull-request-target.yml`

This workflow adds a standardized comment to pull requests to guide contributors through the review process.

**Trigger Events:**

- `pull_request_target`: When a pull request is targeted against a branch.

**Usage:**

- Provides guidelines for contributors to ensure their pull requests adhere to project standards and facilitate a smooth review process.
- Adds a comment to the pull request outlining testing requirements, reviewer assignments, contribution guidelines, and closing procedures.

## Secrets Management

Properly configuring the necessary secrets in your repository settings is crucial for smooth workflow execution. These include:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions for authentication.
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: JSON key file for Firebase service account authentication.

### Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set correctly:

- `VITE_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: Unique identifier for your Firebase project.
- `VITE_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY`: API key to interact with Firebase services.
- `VITE_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`: Domain for Firebase authentication.
- `VITE_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL`: URL of your Firebase Realtime Database.
- `VITE_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`: Cloud storage bucket URL.
- `VITE_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`: Sender ID for Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- `VITE_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID`: Unique identifier for your Firebase app.
- `VITE_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENTID`: Identifier for Google Analytics.
- `VITE_APP_FIREBASE_FCM_VAPID_KEY`: Public key for Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- `CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID`: Identifier for the Cypress project.
- `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY`: Key to record Cypress test results.

**Note:** Ensure thorough configuration of these secrets within your repository settings to prevent any workflow errors. They play a crucial role in authenticating Firebase deployments and accessing the Firebase project. It's imperative to maintain their security and avoid exposing them within your forked repo.
